Why Build a Proxy?
	I. Consolidate messaging protocols.
	Adopt a standard messaging format and protocol (e.g. JSON over HTTP).
	II. Provide a uniform interface (ie. Fa√ßade) to internal services.
	Adapt existing services and expose uniform endpoints (e.g. REST).
	Our goal is to reduce complexity through separation of components and use layered tiers to allow extensions while limiting the effect of changes.
